#   yawn

A bedtime calculator for the command line. (Inspired by [Sleepyti.me](http://sleepyti.me)).

Read a little about the [project](http://www.baligod.com/posts/yawn/).

## Usage

To find out some optimal times to wake up if you were to go to bed right now, just `yawn`. (Assuming it's in your `$PATH`).

![yawn](http://www.baligod.com/static/img/yawn-1.jpg)

If you'd like to wake up at a certain time, you can `yawn -w hh:mm(am|pm)` to find out some good times to go to bed.

![yawn -w](http://www.baligod.com/static/img/yawn-2.jpg)

All times account for the average time to fall asleep (14 minutes). So there's no need to adjust the times, just go to bed immediately or at the specified time.

For help, you can `yawn -h`.

Sleep tight ;)
